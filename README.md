# Description
Have you ever heard of “selling good smell fart”? This is a folk
story in south Asia, the main goal of this story is teaching people to
be kind. How much does animal agriculture and eating meat con-
tribute to global warming? Animal agriculture and eating meat are
the biggest causes of global warming. Becoming vegan or cutting
down on your own personal meat consumption could be the sin-
gle most effective action that you can do to help reduce greenhouse
gas emissions. We want to combine “selling good smell fart” and
reduce greenhouse gas together, it may be hard to imagine how,
but if without those research information, most people know about
eating too much meat which will cause greenhouse gas because of
methane emissions (fart). To focus on this, we create a connection between meat-eating and farting as a cause of greenhouse gas, and this becomes our main game philosophy.
